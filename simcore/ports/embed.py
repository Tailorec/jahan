"""The `EmbedPort` protocol: the one way a core module turns text into vectors.

Embeddings are an optional secondary signal a study may enable; the default path opens no embedding
call and carries no array. The array itself never enters a contract — `schemas` is a leaf — so a built
population carries `EmbeddingRef` positions and the array travels beside it.

The port promises what a real embedding call produces: the vectors in input order, the model that
was pinned and the one that served, and what each batch cost."""
