"""The cost ledger: what a run has spent, derived rather than remembered.

The ledger sums the `cost` events the run recorded, including what failed
calls billed; an unknown cost stays unknown and never becomes zero. On
resume it is rebuilt by summing. A discarded tick's spend is unknown but not
zero, so the figure the ladder tests is pessimistic: recorded spend plus, for
each discarded tick, the mean cost of the ticks that completed.
