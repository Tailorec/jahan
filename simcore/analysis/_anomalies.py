"""Anomalies as rules over what was measured — deterministic arithmetic, no judge model.

Herding reads belief movement against the replicate spread: a trailing window whose mean
move exceeds twice that spread. Backlash reads a split in the sign of belief moves past
a threshold. Flop needs adoption, so until intent exists it reports as not measurable
with its reason, rather than as absent. Thresholds are configuration with documented
defaults, and the applied values travel on every anomaly reported.
