"""Objection clusters: what personas objected to, grouped deterministically.

Objections are chosen from what each turn recorded, embedded once through the run's pinned embedding model,
and grouped by average-linkage cosine similarity at a recorded threshold, with ties broken from a derived seed. Each
cluster is labelled by its medoid — the verbatim nearest the centre, quoted as written.
No k-means, no generated summaries. Two runs over one trace produce one answer.
