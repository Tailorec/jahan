"""One frozen join of the five shapes: belief histories, edges, grouped verbatims,
event counts per kind and costs per role.

`trace_summary` reads a run's record only through the shapes that own each answer —
`beliefs`, `edges`, `verbatims`, `events` — never a path, a frame or a second way in.
One view per world: beliefs, edges and verbatims are per-world derivations, so a
multi-world record is summarized from one scoped view per world. Two summaries of
one trace are identical, so a diff means a difference in the record.
