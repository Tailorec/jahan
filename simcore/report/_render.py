"""Rendering findings and digests into documents, and nothing else.

One call — `render(findings, digests, pack)` — builds one intermediate document, then
formats it twice: markdown for a person, JSON-ready data for the pages. The module may
sort, group and format; it may not derive. Every number it prints is a value from the
finding, digest or pack it came from, rendered with `repr` so it reads exactly as the
record holds it.
