"""What a report is rendered from, besides the findings and digests themselves.

Findings arrive already validated by `analysis`; the pack carries everything else the
document must state: the run configuration (pins, seeds, templates), the run's single
trust statement, the brief pack the assumption ledger is gathered from, the anomalies
and objection clusters to list, the recommended real-world validation, and the engine
commit the run came from. Rendering reads nothing but these three arguments.
